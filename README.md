# Capstone Requirements

### Technical Requirements:
- React client

- User related data
- At least 1 many-many relationship
- At least 1 one-many relationship

### Planning:
- Issue tickets
- Project board
- Wireframes (use whatever tool you want - moqups, lucid charts, photoshop, adobe XD, Figma, etc.)
- ERD
- If you have not fleshed out your planning enough, your mentor will not let you code.

### Documentation:
- Create a readme that shows another dev how to pull down your code and get it running. The bangazon project readme is a good example of this

### These ideas will get rejected:

- Projects shouldn't be for someone who will pay you
- Projects that are super similar to things we have done in class
