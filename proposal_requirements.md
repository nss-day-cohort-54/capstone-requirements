#### An Indecent Proposal

###### Match.dog
  
*What problem does your application solve?*

This app is to match users with the dog of their choice. 

*How will your application work? Features?*

People will give some information that will go through a bunch of dogs and match them with the one that is best for them. I am thinking about using an API but I can't find one that has all of my data yet. People will be able to be able create accounts, save dogs to their account, and delete the dogs from their account.

*Why do you want to build this application?*

I really like dogs and I like it when people adopt dogs, so I want to make sure they are getting the right dog. I want to learn CRUD and React.

*Who are the target users of this application?*

People that like dogs

*Will you have multiple types of users? If so, what can each type of user do?*

Just one type of user




#### A Decent Proposal

###### Boogie and Brush
An Oral Hygiene Promotion App for children.

*What problem does your application solve?*

I plan to build an application to motivate children to brush for a full 2 minutes. The need for this app became clear when the following statistic came across my desk: children only brush their teeth 6 times a week. Because they are not germ-a-phobes (and maybe not even hygenic), they don't know the health benefits of brushing your teeth, so they need a little external nudge. There are plenty of reward systems out there, but a digital one will allow the parents to be a bit less helecopter-y.

*How will your application work? Features?*

When a child logs in to the app, they will be prompted to either see their brushing records or to "brush their teeth now." When they opt to "brush now", they will be guided to a page where they can pick four 30-second song clips from a list. Once they pick these, it will play an animation video (and background music they just selected). Once the video is finished playing, they receive a sticker for completing brushing. If the video is exited before 2 minutes, they will not receive the sticker.

> Parents must create an account for access to the app.

> Child users log in each time they intend to brush their teeth. They can either view their previous brushing records or create a new brushing record.

> If child user opts to create a new brushing record, they are able to select 4 clips from a set of "mystery songs" to compile one 2-minute song. Once they have 4 selections, they are able to play their "custom" song.

> While the child user's "custom" song is playing, they receive step-by-step brushing instructions from an animated slideshow.

> Once the 2-minute animation and song duo is completed. The child receives a "sticker" for brushing. Brushing is limited to once per morning and once per evening.

> Once per week, the parents will be emailed with the results of how many times their child(ren) brushed that week. (STRETCH)

*Why do you want to build this application?*

Personally, I want to use this application to practice/emphasize/show-off 2 skills: flat data structure and understanding of two-way binding with React. I feel like I have been getting away with "squishing" my data and need more practice with using foreign keys. This project would have 3 collections that all relate to one another, so loads of data. I plan to have as few screens as possible, so the application is going to have tons of events, which is going to mean tons of binding.

*Who are the target users of this application?*

Parents that what to teach their kids good habits

*Will you have multiple types of users? If so, what can each type of user do?*

The primary user of the application will be children, the secondary user will be parents. Children will be able to pick their song clips to brush their teeth too and collect stickers. Parents will be able to see the results of their kids brushing.
